# ðŸ§¼ Dabs

## Dabs use one-third of project revenue to buy & distribute floors of top volume NFT projects in the Ethereum ecosystem - forever.

{% hint style="info" %}
[Royal dabs](royal-dabs.md) equal \~1.7% of all secondary market transactions
{% endhint %}

#### Every 1,000 mints 16.5 ETH will be used to dab a random top-15 collection. Any project that ranks top-15 in 30d volume in an Open Sea Category is eligible to be dabbed. Through the mint, a category can only be dabbed once.

#### NFTs purchased via dabs are then randomly sent to Floorbot holders. This process will eventually use Chainlink VRF for selection

Example by mint number:\
1,000: Art project at .11 floor = \~125 NFT bought & distributed to Floorbot holders

2,000: Collectible project at .50 floor = \~30 NFT bought & distributed to Floorbot holders

3,000: Virtual World project at 1.5 floor = \~11 NFT bought & distributed to Floorbot holders

4,000: All project at .03 floor = \~500 NFT bought & distributed to Floorbot holders

#### Floorbot holders who dab are encouraged to hold their gifted NFT. As our dabs involve top collections on Ethereum & Open Sea - our shared clean future is _bright!_
