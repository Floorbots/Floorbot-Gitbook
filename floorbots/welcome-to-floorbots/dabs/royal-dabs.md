# ðŸ’¸ Royal Dabs

Royal Dabs originate from project royalties. One-third of the 5% monthly royalties (\~1.7% of all secondary market sales) will be used for dabbing, where candidates are voted on by Floorbot holders.

The Floorbot team will produce three options for holders to vote on each month. Voting will be done on chain with minimal (to no) gas costs required.

| Date                 | Action                       | Duration            |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------- |
| 1st Sunday of month  | Budget declared              | -                   |
| 1st Sunday of month  | Voting Opens                 | 7 days              |
| 2nd Sunday of month  | Dabbing begins               | 3-7 days to acquire |
| By 25th of the month | Selected project distributed | -                   |

Inexact timelines are provided to prevent holders of dabbed projects from front running Floorbot buys. In most cases, Floorbot holders will receive their dabs between the 15-25th of any given month.
